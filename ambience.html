<h5>Did you know that plants could improve your sleep?</h2>
  <p>
    It is known that plants could have a calming effect that could help your bedroom's environment, but their benefits don't stop there. There are many different ways a plant could help you wake up refreshed. Here you will find which are the best plants!

  </p>
<h6>Best air-purifying plants</h3>
<div>
<ol>
  <li>The Sansevieria plant, also known as snake plant, is a bedroom star: it tolerates low (bedroom) light and thrives off some neglect. Did you know that snake plants even convert carbon dioxide to oxygen during the night? This is proven by several studies and thus makes this plant the green star in your bedroom!</li>
  <li>Aloe Vera is known for its skin benefits, but it also removes benzene and formaldehyde from the air.</li>
  <li>Another plant that removes toxins is the Spider Plant ("Chlorophytum comosum"). Very very easy to care for, you can also propagate Spider Plants  by planting the plantlets in pottin soil!. And they look fun as well.</li>
  <li> For the most adventurous ones, if you want a more exotic touch in your room, a Philodendron is a great choice. Grow it along your bed canopy or a wall for instant style. It also has air-purifying capacities.</li>
